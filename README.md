# illuminated-sign
In this project, a function block diagram is made to implement an illuminated sign, using
LOGO! Soft Comfort from Siemens. The illuminated sign consists of lighting up a set of LEDs. These represent the program's digital outputs, as well as the sign's characters.

The illuminated sign functions in three ways. In the first mode, each character is lit up, followed by deactivating the previous one. Each LED is switched on for a short period of time, then it is turned off, followed by the next one to be lit up, until every character is covered. In the second mode, the characters are lit up successively, without switching off the previous ones. In the last mode, three consecutive flashes are made, all characters being lit up at the same time.

All modes are repeated continuously, until the user intervenes.
